## Running the Server

To run the server, navigate to the `server` folder and run a local server to serve the folder. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP or MAMP for this. If not, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
php -S localhost:80 -t server
```

**Note:** If you are not using XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP, and instead have your own MySQL configuration, please make sure to adjust the necessary settings in the project's code to ensure the server runs correctly.
